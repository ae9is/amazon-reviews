          "text": "Good set of strings for a great price.  Compared to other strings from D'addario, Gibson, and Elixer, these strings are a much better value since they are so cheap.  However, in all the years that I have been playing, I have not once said, &#34;man this guitar is great, what kind of strings are these?&#34;  Great guitars play and sound great, period, given of course that you are using at least decent strings.  I know that every guitarist has their go-to strings, as do I (and the brands and styles vary across each of my guitars), but honestly strings are strings.  These days, so much attention is paid to the manufacturing of these strings, that the quality and consistency is great across a number of different brands.  Generally, I can't tell much of a difference in tone, playability, or &#34;slinky-ness&#34; across brands.  (I can hear the groans now) Hear me out though, if I want to change the tone, I will get a different string gauge, and this is the same for slinkyness.  In the end, given 5 sets of top notch strings, I will pick the fresh set vs. a worn set 10 times out of 10.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very cheap for 3 sets of strings, that means you can change more often, which in turn means that these strings will feel and sound better longer<br /><br />I feel like they definitely last longer than say Gibson vintage strings, but most coated, modern strings will be comparable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Strings are strings, and given a good set of strings, I would only base this recommendation on price and great value (5 stars for that).  If you are just starting out, I recommend you try a number of different strings to find your preference, but usually in a pinch whatever my local shop has on hand has worked just fine.",

          "text": "My experience with guitar started in the 70s with a beat up acoustic my dad handed down to me. I was enthralled with the sounds of the guitar, but hated that giant hunk of junk. In the early 80s I got myself a job, tossed that pile of warped wood, and bought myself a Gibson electric. A friend quickly turned me on to GHS Boomers, which I used exclusively for probably 7-8 years. I had tried several other brands, but for me, the Boomers were the best.<br /><br />Well, the 90s came around, and my musical taste changed from alt-rock to a heavier sound. My preference transitioned from Gibson guitars through Orange and Mesa/Boogie amps to Jackson guitars through Marshall amps. Due to budgetary constraints, I switched to Carvin strings -- they used to be incredibly affordable -- but \"discovered\" the Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings when a guitar tech friend of mine restrung one of my super-strats for me, and that was that.<br /><br />So what do 'Slinkies' do?<br /><br />1. Bend forever.<br />2. Quack on a Strat with the best of 'em!<br />3. NOT break when setting up a Floyd Rose.<br />4. Last for as long as you can stand rubbing the oxidation off of the higher strings.<br /><br />Okay, you get the picture. In a nutshell, these are high-quality strings at an affordable price, delivering the best tone out there. Novice or pro; you won't be disappointed.",

          "text": "I don't even know if I need to review these, these are the gold standard for guitar strings as far as I'm concerned. I've been using them for 25 years. Every now and then I stray and try a d'addario or GHS or some such, but I always come back to these. Nice balanced sound. Not too punchy, not too muddy. Great feel. Not too grippy, not too slippery. Ernie Ball needs to make a package that offers bonus (high) E-G strings though, I go through those well before the low strings are needing to be changed.",
