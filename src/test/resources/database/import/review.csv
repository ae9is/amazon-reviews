585Great little side table, would buy again.I bought this table for our living room/sitting room and I think it is perfect for a smaller space. It's very sturdy once everything is tightened down and the colors are great. The top is rustic and elegant but I don't believe it's sealed in any type of fashion, so beware of water damage, etc.B08GCR1G1RB08GCR1G1R160097053031620t
3215914The super slinky seemed to be the best for me so ...I started learning how to play the guitar about 1 month ago. I was started off playing with the standard string that I got with my guitar. Even though I practice frequently, my fingers still hurt. I decided to do some research on how to fix my problem and one of the solutions was to get a different set of strings. The super slinky  seemed to be the best for me so I bought it. After setting up the strings and doing a practice session, I can honestly say that it made a difference. The strings were a bit easier to play with and my fingers did not hurt as much. It is not a magic set of strings that will take away the finger pains for a beginner but it will definitely help, especially if you are buying it for a child.B00CAUYNCOB0BSGM6CQ91518543937466132t
5067885Good set of strings for a great priceGood set of strings for a great price.  Compared to other strings from D'addario, Gibson, and Elixer, these strings are a much better value since they are so cheap.  However, in all the years that I have been playing, I have not once said, &#34;man this guitar is great, what kind of strings are these?&#34;  Great guitars play and sound great, period, given of course that you are using at least decent strings.  I know that every guitarist has their go-to strings, as do I (and the brands and styles vary across each of my guitars), but honestly strings are strings.  These days, so much attention is paid to the manufacturing of these strings, that the quality and consistency is great across a number of different brands.  Generally, I can't tell much of a difference in tone, playability, or &#34;slinky-ness&#34; across brands.  (I can hear the groans now) Hear me out though, if I want to change the tone, I will get a different string gauge, and this is the same for slinkyness.  In the end, given 5 sets of top notch strings, I will pick the fresh set vs. a worn set 10 times out of 10.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very cheap for 3 sets of strings, that means you can change more often, which in turn means that these strings will feel and sound better longer<br /><br />I feel like they definitely last longer than say Gibson vintage strings, but most coated, modern strings will be comparable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Strings are strings, and given a good set of strings, I would only base this recommendation on price and great value (5 stars for that).  If you are just starting out, I recommend you try a number of different strings to find your preference, but usually in a pinch whatever my local shop has on hand has worked just fine.B00CAV0TRQB0BSGM6CQ91512373015319121t
7718015The gold standard for stringsI don't even know if I need to review these, these are the gold standard for guitar strings as far as I'm concerned. I've been using them for 25 years. Every now and then I stray and try a d'addario or GHS or some such, but I always come back to these. Nice balanced sound. Not too punchy, not too muddy. Great feel. Not too grippy, not too slippery. Ernie Ball needs to make a package that offers bonus (high) E-G strings though, I go through those well before the low strings are needing to be changed.B00CAV0TRQB0BSGM6CQ9149376388300084t
13035395Mandatory ReadTake this to heart. I have been playing for 16 years this Christmas. For the first seven years I experimented with different brands and gauges. These were the strings I settled on after all that experimentation and I have never looked back. Slinky 9's are ALL I have bought for the past nine years. There are two types of electric guitar strings: Expensive and cheap. NEVER buy cheap strings. They sound too bright and about one out of twenty will break when you wind them up. Expensive strings are a little more complicated. The durability factor is much better with expensive strings. About one out of eighty will break. The difference between the expensive brands is in the sound. Some are "tinny" or bright. Some sound like bass strings tuned way up. With that said, Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9's have what I call a "V" voicing. It's like they have a little equalizer built in set to a good rock setting. You know, boost the mids and highs and roll back the mids. THESE... are the only strings designed specifically for rock/metal/southern rock/progressive heavier jam bands/etc. Period.<br /><br />Man... I sound like a commercial. It's because I am passionate about these strings.B0002M6CW6B0BSGM6CQ91148893055000219f
15638645Love the Super Slinky strings!My experience with guitar started in the 70s with a beat up acoustic my dad handed down to me. I was enthralled with the sounds of the guitar, but hated that giant hunk of junk. In the early 80s I got myself a job, tossed that pile of warped wood, and bought myself a Gibson electric. A friend quickly turned me on to GHS Boomers, which I used exclusively for probably 7-8 years. I had tried several other brands, but for me, the Boomers were the best.<br /><br />Well, the 90s came around, and my musical taste changed from alt-rock to a heavier sound. My preference transitioned from Gibson guitars through Orange and Mesa/Boogie amps to Jackson guitars through Marshall amps. Due to budgetary constraints, I switched to Carvin strings -- they used to be incredibly affordable -- but "discovered" the Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings when a guitar tech friend of mine restrung one of my super-strats for me, and that was that.<br /><br />So what do 'Slinkies' do?<br /><br />1. Bend forever.<br />2. Quack on a Strat with the best of 'em!<br />3. NOT break when setting up a Floyd Rose.<br />4. Last for as long as you can stand rubbing the oxidation off of the higher strings.<br /><br />Okay, you get the picture. In a nutshell, these are high-quality strings at an affordable price, delivering the best tone out there. Novice or pro; you won't be disappointed.B0002M6CW6B0BSGM6CQ9121194724700094f

15643675Best Electric Guitar Strings in ExistenceI just turned 60 years old and I've been playing guitar since I was 13 - I've tried every make of string, and played most every model of guitar as well, and these are the only strings I use. I recently bought a used guitar which was strung with something else - couldn't wait to get the EB strings on there. Nothing else has the feel and sound - they just have a musicality and aliveness to them and manufacturing quality has been consistent over the years. I'd recommend these for any guitar, any style - harmonics, sustain, feel - they have it all. Only decision is .010's or .009's - I like to use .010's when tuned down to E flat, and .009's for standard tuning. If you don't like your guitar and it's strung with other strings, try these.B0002M6CVCB0BSGM6CQ91386947410000129t
29293515Wow what soundi got a cheap starter guitar a few years ago with some unknown, worn out strings. put these in and it woke the guitar up! sounds so much better and took care of a lot of buzzing i was having with the old strings. thanks Tom Delonge, haha!B0002PBS68B0BSGM6CQ916924121927560t
29514515Great stringsI had my eyes on some Ernie ball zippy slinky’s for a while now but every guitar store I went to didn’t have them so I looked on Amazon and here they are for only 8 bucks! When I put them on my guitar it felt less restraining from other strings I tried you can bend really high so I give a 5 star review 100% recommend.B0002GYXOGB0BSGM6CQ916923827484640t
