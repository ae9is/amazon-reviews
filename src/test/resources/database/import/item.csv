The voice architecture is identical to a single voice of the Prophet '08, an eight-voice synthesizer with a 100% analog signal path, yet with a couple of unique twists to distinguish it from its award-winning sibling. Dave Smith Instruments have added two sub-octave generatorsone per oscillatorfor additional girth and crushing basses. It also has an audio input that lets you process external audio and mix Mopho's own audio output back in pre-filter for feedback effects that can range from subtle distortion to extreme skronk. The \"Push It!\" button is a manual trigger that lets you play a specific note or latch notes and sequences on. The Mopho Monophonic Synthesizer can also step through a sequence to play short melodic lines without a keyboard. Mopho can also be used with a MIDI controller or external sequencer.Mopho is fully programmable and all the parameters can be tweaked from the front panel. The four Assignable Parameters controls are assignable per program for optimal performance control. A free editor is available for Mac OS and Windows to facilitate programming. If you already have a Prophet '08, most of Mopho's parameters can be controlled from the Prophet's front panel via MIDI.Mopho is perfect for people who want to learn the ins and outs of real analog synthesis without spending a bundle, DJs looking to add some old-school sonic spice to their setups, and musicians who will appreciate a great-sounding, very portable mono synth."}Dave Smith Instruments{"Brand": "Dave Smith Instruments", "Color": "Yellow", "Color Name": "Yellow", "Item Weight": "2.65 pounds", "Body Material": "Bass Wood", "Connector Type": "USB Type B", "Special Feature": "Mopho is a compact and affordable—but powerful—monophonic analog synthesizer.
